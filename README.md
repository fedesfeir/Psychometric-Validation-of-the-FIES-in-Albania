# Psychometric-Validation-of-the-FIES-in-Albania
This project applies the **Rasch model** to the *Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES)* using FAO microdata for Albania (2017). The aim is to validate the psychometric properties of the scale and estimate food insecurity prevalence across sociodemographic subgroups.
## Main steps
- Data exploration and cleaning
- Descriptive statistics (gender, education, area, income)
- Rasch model estimation (item difficulty, person ability)
- Model diagnostics and item fit
- Differential Item Functioning (DIF) analysis
- Prevalence estimation by gender, area, income, education
